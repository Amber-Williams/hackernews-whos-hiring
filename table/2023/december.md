I've previously worked in developer relations at Cloudant (YC S08), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11), and explored AI/ML (computer vision for self-driving cars) before diving deep into crypto.We started with the idea of a privacy-first browser with built-in micropayments (via the Interledger Protocol) and have since added support for identity (HNS, ENS; Unstoppable Domains in testing) and storage (IPFS; Arweave in testing).We just soft launched Anthropic and OpenAI integrations and excited to make your browser smarter, do more things for you and further explore intersection of crypto & ai. 
Incentive and governance structures for AI companies and training/running LLMs in a decentralized way is a particularly interesting direction imho.We recently surpassed 750k downloads and are excited to grow our team. Our investors include Protocol Labs, Shima Capital, Fenbushi, Don Ho (Orange DAO), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (ex-GitHub CTO), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol, Google Deep Learning, TensorFlow) and many more.Our Values:- We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.
- Two recurring weekly meetings to maximize state of flow – Monday all-hands, Friday Demos.
- Careful with growth and never had to do layoffs.

Doctors spend twice as much time with computers as they do with patients; our product helps doctors make decisions and draft documentation in seconds. To date, tens of thousands of clinicians have used Glass to generate drafts of differential diagnoses and clinical plans.We went through Y Combinator this year and recently announced a $5M seed round (led by Initialized), which included some of the most brilliant founders in healthtech: Tom Lee, founder of One Medical; Connor Landgraf, founder and CEO of Eko Health; and Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, the co-founders of FIGS. We’ve also been featured in leading clinical lectures like UCSF Grand Rounds and news outlets like NPR and TechCrunch.This is a hybrid role: we work in person at an office in San Francisco two days a week. Remote is optional for the remaining days, although the office space is fully available at any time! Unfortunately, we are unable to offer visa sponsorship.

Our technology allows first responders to get eyes and ears on what's happening in indoor structures when it's too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergencies, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.In addition to launching more advanced drones, we're also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps.  This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.It’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.Job Postings:- Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...- Senior/Principal Backend & Platform Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...Some recent press:- https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...- https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/I'm the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about to role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you're interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
